# 🗓️ University Timetable Selector - Final Certification Project

## 📌 Project Description

This is a **desktop GUI application** built with **Python** that allows university students to **select and manage their courses** based on a structured timetable in CSV format. The app enables students to filter courses by year or course code and save their selected subjects into a custom list.

This project was developed as the **final certification assignment** for the Python training program I completed.

## 💡 Key Features

- 📂 Load course data from a CSV file  
- 🎓 Filter courses by academic year or course code  
- ✅ Select and save preferred courses  
- 📥 Save selected courses to a new CSV  
- 🧼 Clean and intuitive user interface built with CustomTkinter

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3  
- 📊 Pandas  
- 🎨 CustomTkinter (modern UI for tkinter)  
- 🧠 re (Regular Expressions)  
- 📁 filedialog & messagebox (from tkinter)

# Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create practical desktop applications using Python, manage data using Pandas, and build user-friendly interfaces with CustomTkinter.
